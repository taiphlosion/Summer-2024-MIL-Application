# Summer-2024-MIL-Application
Part of the submission of application for the Software Team of the Machine Intelligence Laboratory (Summer 2024)

# Setup 
- Place the .env file that I sent into the root directory. 
- cd into client and run "npm i"
- From there, you can run "npm start"
- cd into server and run "npm i"
- For the server diectory, run "node ." in it

From there, you should be locally hosting the website and API locally. From there, feel free to test out the website. 

# Project Stack
- Node
- Express.js
- Postman
- React
- MongoDB

# About
So the API has a basic React front-end to it that allows you to properly use it. It fulfills every method and function laid out in the project documentation. This was my first time developing an API like this but I had a lot of fun working on it. You would need Node installed to test it out.
